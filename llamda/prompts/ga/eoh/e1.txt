{description}
I have {m} existing algorithms with their codes as follows:
{indivs}
Please help me create a new algorithm that has a totally different form from the given ones.
First, describe your new algorithm and main steps in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace. Next, implement it in Python as a function named {func_name}. This function should accept {n_inputs} input(s): {func_inputs}. The function should return {n_outputs} output(s): {func_outputs}.{inout_info} {other_info}
Do not give additional explanations.
