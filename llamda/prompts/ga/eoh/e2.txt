{description}
I have {m} existing algorithms with their codes as follows:
{indivs}
Please help me create a new algorithm that has a totally different form from the given ones but can be motivated from them.
Firstly, identify the common backbone idea in the provided algorithms. Secondly, based on the backbone idea describe your new algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace. Thirdly, implement it in Python as a function named {func_name}. This function should accept {n_inputs} input(s): {func_inputs}. The function should return {n_outputs} output(s): {func_outputs}.{inout_info} {other_info}
Do not give additional explanations.
