{{ description }}
I have {{ indivs|length }} existing algorithms with their codes and objective values as follows:
{% for indiv in indivs %}
No.{{ loop.index }} algorithm's description, its corresponding code and its objective value are:
{{ indiv.algorithm }}
{{ indiv.code }}
Objective value: {{ indiv.obj }}

{% endfor %}
Please create a new algorithm that has a similar form to the No.{{ indivs|length }} algorithm and is inspired by the No.1 algorithm. The new algorithm should have a objective value lower than both algorithms.
Firstly, list the common ideas in the No.1 algorithm that may give good performances. Secondly, based on the common idea, describe the design idea based on the No.{{ indivs|length }} algorithm and main steps of your algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace. Thirdly, implement it in Python as a function named '{{ func_name }}'.
This function should accept {{ func_inputs|length }} input(s): {{ func_inputs|quote_and_join }}. The function should return {{ func_outputs|length }} output(s): {{ func_outputs|quote_and_join }}. {{ inout_info }} {{ other_info }}
Do not give additional explanations.
