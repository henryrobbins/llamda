{{ description }}
I have {{ indivs|length }} existing algorithms with their codes as follows:
{% for indiv in indivs %}
No.{{ loop.index }} algorithm's description, its corresponding code and  its objective value are:
{{ indiv.algorithm }}
{{ indiv.code }}
Objective value: {{ indiv.obj }}

{% endfor %}
Please create a new algorithm that has a totally different form from the given algorithms. Try generating codes with different structures, flows or algorithms. The new algorithm should have a relatively low objective value.
First, describe the design idea and main steps of your algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace outside the code implementation. Next, implement it in Python as a function named '{{ func_name }}'.
This function should accept {{ func_inputs|length }} input(s): {{ func_inputs|quote_and_join }}. The function should return {{ func_outputs|length }} output(s): {{ func_outputs|quote_and_join }}. {{ inout_info }} {{ other_info }}
Do not give additional explanations.
