The algorithm focuses on prioritizing nodes with higher distances to explore alternative paths, aiming for a diverse stochastic solution sampling approach for tackling the Traveling Salesman Problem. The code randomly selects a starting node and iterates through available nodes, selecting the next node based on the maximum distance from the current node, incrementing the heuristic value for the chosen edge in the heuristics matrix. This encourages the algorithm to explore longer paths and potentially find a more optimal solution.
