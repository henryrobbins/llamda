The algorithm selects the next node by randomly choosing a starting node and then iteratively selecting the node with the shortest distance from the current node. The distances between nodes are used to prioritize the selection of the next node, while updating a heuristics matrix to track the most promising edges to include in the solution. The algorithm combines random sampling and greedy selection to efficiently find a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
