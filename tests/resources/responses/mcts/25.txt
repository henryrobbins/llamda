The algorithm prioritizes selecting nodes with longer distances in the distance matrix to update indicators on the chosen edges. It iterates through each node, selecting the next node with the maximum distance, and incrementing the corresponding indicators in the heuristics matrix. This approach aims to guide the stochastic solution sampling towards paths that potentially lead to shorter overall distances in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.
