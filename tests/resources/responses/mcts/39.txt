The algorithm prioritizes selecting the next node based on both the shortest distance and the highest heuristics value in the row of the current node in the heuristics matrix. It balances between exploration (via heuristic scores) and exploitation (via distances) to find the optimal path for the Traveling Salesman Problem. The code randomly selects a starting node, calculates heuristic scores for available nodes, and updates the heuristics matrix based on the selected nodes.
