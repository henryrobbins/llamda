The heuristic algorithm prioritizes nodes with longer distances by repeatedly selecting the node with the maximum distance from the current node. It updates indicators based on the reverse order of distances, emphasizing edges with higher distances in the solution. The algorithm aims to guide the stochastic sampling towards exploring paths that potentially reduce the overall traveled distance in the Traveling Salesman Problem.
