The algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem incorporates a dynamic factor that adjusts the selection of the next node based on the combination of the current shortest distance and the frequency of edges already chosen, allowing for a diverse exploration of potential solutions. The algorithm prioritizes selecting the next node based on a heuristic that considers both the distance to the node and the frequency of edges already chosen, aiming to find a more optimal path while exploring different possibilities in each iteration. The heuristics_matrix keeps track of the frequency of edges chosen to guide the selection process, ultimately contributing to finding a more efficient solution to the TSP.
