The algorithm utilizes a random initial solution that is then refined through local search to optimize the TSP solution by exploring different edges and swapping nodes in the solution. The focus is on constantly improving the current solution by assessing the cost of the new solution and updating the heuristics matrix accordingly to guide future search. The algorithm balances exploration (random initial solution) and exploitation (local search) strategies to find an efficient solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem.
