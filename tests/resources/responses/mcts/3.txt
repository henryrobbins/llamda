The provided algorithm creates a heuristic matrix based on probabilities derived from the distances between nodes in the given distance matrix. It randomly selects edges to include in a solution iteratively, updating the indicators to guide the selection process towards finding the shortest path for the Traveling Salesman Problem. The algorithm prioritizes calculating probabilities for each edge based on the inverse of the distance between nodes and iteratively selects edges with higher probabilities to build a solution.
