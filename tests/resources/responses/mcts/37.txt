The algorithm prioritizes edge selection based on the ratio of distances to the number of times an edge has been included in the solution, while iterating through nodes randomly selected from the distance matrix. The algorithm updates a heuristics matrix to keep track of the count of edges selected, with higher counts indicating higher priority for the edges. The algorithm aims to find the most promising edges to include in a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
