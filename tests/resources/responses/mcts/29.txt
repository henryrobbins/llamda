The algorithm randomly selects a starting node and iteratively chooses the next node based on the shortest distance, updating a matrix to track promising edges. It prioritizes selecting the next node with the shortest distance and updates the heuristic matrix to reflect these choices. The algorithm aims to find the shortest path that visits all nodes efficiently by iteratively selecting nodes based on distance metrics.
