The algorithm selects the next node based on the combination of the shortest distance from the current node and the frequency of visiting that node in previous iterations, aiming to balance exploration and exploitation. The code prioritizes calculating the combined score of distances and frequencies to determine the next node, while updating the heuristics matrix to keep track of node visit frequencies. The algorithm iterates through the available nodes to construct a solution following the described heuristic criteria.
