The algorithm aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem by prioritizing node selection based on both distance and attractiveness of edges. The heuristics matrix is initialized and updated iteratively by considering the ratio of distance to heuristics information for each edge. The algorithm randomly selects a starting node and iterates through available nodes, choosing the next node with the highest combined attractiveness.
