The algorithm aims to find a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem by updating indicators on chosen edges based on a weighted approach. It prioritizes nodes with shorter distances and higher currently assigned indicators, leading to a more efficient selection of edges. The code initializes a matrix to store indicators, randomly selects nodes to start exploring the graph, and updates the indicators based on a weighted distance calculation.
