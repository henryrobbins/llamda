The heuristic algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem gradually increases the probability of selecting less promising edges to explore new paths while still utilizing a greedy approach. It prioritizes exploring unvisited nodes based on their previous indicators, aiming to find an optimal path without getting stuck in local optima. The algorithm uses a distance matrix to calculate probabilities for selecting the next node, iteratively updating the heuristics matrix to guide the exploration process.
