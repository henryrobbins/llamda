The heuristic algorithm utilizes local search refinement by iteratively updating chosen edges in the solution, prioritizing connections that lead to a lower cost. It combines random and guided exploration strategies by selecting promising connections based on the cost of the new solution compared to the current one. The algorithm aims to find the shortest path by repeatedly adjusting the chosen edges until an improved solution is no longer possible.
