The algorithm generates a heuristic matrix by iterating through nodes and updating the edge selection probabilities based on historical choices. It prioritizes exploring different paths efficiently by favoring edges that have not been frequently selected, adjusting the probabilities after each edge choice. The code uses random selection and updates the probabilities dynamically to guide the search for the shortest path in the Traveling Salesman Problem.
