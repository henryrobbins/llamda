The algorithm uses a heuristic approach to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem by iteratively swapping nodes in a random initial solution to minimize the total distance traveled. It focuses on exploring different neighborhoods and exploiting local improvements to efficiently find a suboptimal path. The priority is given to the current solution and its cost, as well as the heuristics matrix that indicates the promising edges to include in the solution.
