The algorithm uses stochastic sampling to select the next node to visit based on a probability distribution determined by the distances to each unvisited node, resulting in a different approach to solving the TSP problem. It prioritizes selecting nodes with shorter distances from the current node to potentially create a shorter overall path. The algorithm iterates through all nodes in a random order and updates a heuristics matrix based on the selected paths.
