The implemented heuristic algorithm randomly samples a solution by greedily adding edges with the shortest distances from a given distance matrix. The algorithm updates indicators on the chosen edges, prioritizing nodes with shorter distances, until all nodes are visited. The critical design idea of the algorithm is to iteratively select the next node with the shortest distance and update the indicators accordingly, resulting in a stochastic solution sampling approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.
