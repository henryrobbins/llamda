Common Backbone Idea: The common backbone idea in the provided algorithms is that they both calculate a heuristics matrix based on the distance matrix to indicate the promise of including each edge in the solution.

{Create a heuristics matrix by taking the inverse of the squared root of the distances in the distance matrix.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = 1 / (np.sqrt(distance_matrix[i, j]) ** 2)

    return heuristics_matrix
```
