The common backbone idea in the provided algorithms is to calculate a heuristics matrix based on the inverse of the distance matrix.

{Create a new algorithm that normalizes the distance matrix before calculating the heuristics matrix by taking the reciprocal of the squared distances.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / np.max(distance_matrix)
    heuristics_matrix = 1 / (normalized_distance_matrix ** 2)
    
    return heuristics_matrix
```
