Common backbone idea in the provided algorithms: Calculating heuristics matrix based on the squared reciprocal of distances in the distance matrix and subtracting the minimum value.

{Calculate heuristics matrix by taking the reciprocal of the square root of the distances in the distance matrix and subtracting the maximum value in the resulting matrix.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = 1 / (np.sqrt(distance_matrix[i, j])) 

    max_val = np.max(heuristics_matrix)
    heuristics_matrix -= max_val

    return heuristics_matrix
```
