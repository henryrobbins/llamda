{
The new algorithm calculates the heuristics matrix as the product of the reciprocal of the distances in the distance matrix and the inverse of the square root of the sum of distances to each node for each node.
}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = 1 / distance_matrix[i, j] * (1 / np.sqrt(np.sum(distance_matrix[i, :])))

    return heuristics_matrix
```
