The common backbone idea in the provided algorithms is the manipulation of the distance values in the distance matrix to obtain heuristics values for each edge.

{Calculate the heuristics matrix by taking the square root of the sum of the reciprocal of the distances in the distance matrix and their squares.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = np.sqrt((1 / distance_matrix[i, j]) + (1 / distance_matrix[i, j]) ** 2)

    return heuristics_matrix
```
