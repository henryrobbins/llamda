The common backbone idea in the provided algorithms is prioritizing edges with lower distances in the construction of the heuristics matrix.
 
{Construct a new algorithm that creates a heuristics matrix by normalizing the distance matrix and taking the reciprocal value of each element.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    heuristics_matrix = 1 / distance_matrix
    return heuristics_matrix
```
