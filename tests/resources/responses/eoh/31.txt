{
The new algorithm will calculate the heuristics matrix by taking the inverse of the distances in the distance matrix and then raising it to the power of 0.5.
}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = 1 / (distance_matrix[i, j] ** 0.5)

    return heuristics_matrix
```
