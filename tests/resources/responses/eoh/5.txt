{
New algorithm creates a heuristics matrix based on the distance matrix to indicate the promise of including each edge in the solution. 
}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = 1 / distance_matrix[i, j]

    return heuristics_matrix
```
