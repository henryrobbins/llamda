{
New algorithm involves sampling stochastic solutions by prioritizing edges with lower distances, resulting in a heuristic matrix used to guide the construction of the solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    heuristics_matrix = 1 / distance_matrix
    return heuristics_matrix
```
