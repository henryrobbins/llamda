Common backbone idea: Calculating a heuristic value based on the reciprocal and/or square of distances in the distance matrix.

New algorithm description: {The new algorithm calculates the heuristics matrix by taking the logarithm of the reciprocal of the distances in the distance matrix.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    num_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = np.log(1 / distance_matrix[i, j])

    return heuristics_matrix
```
