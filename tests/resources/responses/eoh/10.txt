The common backbone idea in the provided algorithms is to calculate a heuristic matrix based on the inverse of the distances in the distance matrix.

{Calculate the heuristics matrix by taking the natural logarithm of the reciprocal of the distances in the distance matrix.}

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristics(distance_matrix):
    heuristics_matrix = np.log(1 / distance_matrix)
    return heuristics_matrix
```
